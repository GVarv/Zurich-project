# Data-sharing, reanalysis and sensitivity analysis of overall survival and progression-free survival of pivotal randomized controlled trials in oncology

### Objectives:
Clinical Trial Data Sharing has improved a lot recently, but its implementation is still not optimal. This limits the ability to verify the reproducibility of trial results, which is needed to indicate it as trustworthy and robust. <br />
The cross-sectional study –whose protocol we describe here– will analyse the level of data sharing and reproducibility of main studies that supported EMA authorizations of oncological medicines. <br />
It will also evaluate the robustness of their conclusion due to different censoring rules and attrition bias. <br />
### Design: 
We will first identify all oncologic indications –new drugs or extension of indications– that received a positive opinion from the CHMP between January 01, 2020, and December 31, 2024. Then we will identify all RCTs referred to as  ‘main studies’ in the European public assessment report and randomly sample 60 of them. <br />
For each sampled RCT we will ask for IPD, protocols and information on how the study was conducted, which will be used to reanalyse the two main oncological endpoints (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS]) of each trial for estimand, effect size, p-value and conclusion. Two independent researchers will discuss whether the differences between the original analysis and ours affect the conclusion and if the study can be considered reproducible. <br />
Afterwards, we will analyse the impact of censoring for OS and PFS, performing a reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess the presence of differential censoring and risk of attrition bias. Finally, we will re-analyse the IPD using different ways to handle censoring and compare the results to evaluate the robustness of the study. <br />
### Results: 
The first outcomes we will report are the proportion of trials for which we will be granted access to the data requested and the percentage of studies reproduced for OS and PFS. <br />
We will also review the different censoring rules used among the studies to identify patterns. Then we will use them to compare the results for both endpoints under different rules and report the proportion of studies not robust to censoring rule change and the impact that different rules have in terms of OS or PFS, together with the proportion of studies that present informative censoring. <br />
### Conclusions:
Confirming the reproducibility of trial results is needed to increase trust in research. In the case in which the trials will not be reproducible, recommendations on how to improve reproducibility would be provided, which will hopefully help to improve reproducibility in the future.
